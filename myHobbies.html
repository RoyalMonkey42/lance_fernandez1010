			I was not really thoroughly introduced to basketball until I was <br>
			in the fourth grade. I joined my school's club and have been playing <br>
			ever since. As I got older, I played it more consistently at the basketball <br>
			court in our neighborhood and also played during intramurals at my school. <br>
			It ended up becoming the main sport I play and I absolutely love it! It <br>
			was also a hobby I shared with my brothers so it allowed me to bond with <br>
			them as well.

		My grandfather introduced me to chess when I was around 10 years old <br>
		and I found it really interesting! I used to play with him a lot until <br>
		I started playing my brothers. Chess became a little competition we would <br>
		have to see who was the best. Earlier on in my life, I would say my older <br>
		brother was the best at chess. However, around 8th grade, I started playing <br>
		more seriously. I won chess competitions at a few of my schools and ended up <br>
		beating my older brother. 
		
		<br>
		<br>
		More recently, I have been wanting to take chess to the next level. I am <br>
		playing a whole lot more, watching youtube videos on how the grandmasters <br>
		play, and looking at chess strategies so I can improve even more as a player. <br>
		I even watched the Netflix show, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10048342/"> <i> The Queen's Gambit </i> </a>, <br> 
		and was even inspired more to get better at the game. <br>

		Another thing that something my brothers and I have bonded over when we were <br>
		younger is anime. One of the first animes I have watched is Naruto. This has <br>
		to be my favorite anime because I love the characters, the plot, and the message <br>
		behind it. It is very inspiring and is a really great show to watch. My favorite <br>
		character is Neji Hyuga because he is very smart and is a really skilled fighter. <br>
